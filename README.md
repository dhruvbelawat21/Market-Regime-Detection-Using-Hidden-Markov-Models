Overview
This project involves the development of a quantitative trading model utilizing Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the Baum-Welch algorithm. The model is designed to accurately categorize market regimes (bullish, bearish), facilitating informed decision-making and strategy formulation in financial markets.

Features
Market Regime Categorization: The HMM-based model categorizes market regimes into bullish and bearish states, aiding in strategic investment decisions.
Optimization of Trading Strategies: By analyzing shifts in asset returnsâ€™ means, variances, and covariances, the model ensures agile adaptation to dynamic macroeconomic changes and market conditions.
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques to adapt to changing market conditions without the need for labeled data.


Methodology
Hidden Markov Models (HMM): The core of the model is based on HMM, which helps in identifying hidden states (market regimes) from observable data (market returns).
Baum-Welch Algorithm: An iterative algorithm used to estimate the parameters of the HMM. It maximizes the likelihood of the observed data given the model, leading to accurate categorization of market regimes.
Analysis of Asset Returns: The model examines the means, variances, and covariances of asset returns to detect shifts and adapt trading strategies accordingly.
